// MARK: - Health Analysis Models (Specialized)
// 
// Note: Core health analysis models like HealthAnalysisResponse and HealthAnalysisData
// are already defined in APIResponseModels.swift to avoid duplicate declarations.
//
// This file is reserved for additional health analysis models that don't conflict
// with existing definitions in:
// - APIResponseModels.swift (lines 732-800+)
// - BackendModels.swift 
// - Other core model files
//
// If you need to add new health analysis models, ensure they don't duplicate
// existing type names to avoid Swift compilation errors.

// MARK: - Additional Health Analysis Support Models
// Add non-conflicting health analysis support models here as needed
