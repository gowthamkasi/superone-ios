# Skeleton Loading Implementation Plan
**Super One iOS App - Comprehensive Loading States**

## Overview

This plan implements consistent skeleton loading across all views in the Super One iOS app to provide a professional, polished user experience during data loading states. The implementation will standardize the existing skeleton components and extend them throughout the application.

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Existing Implementations
- **ProfileView**: Custom `SkeletonView` with shimmer animation for profile data loading
- **TestDetailsView**: Sophisticated skeleton loading with `loadingSkeletonCard` and `loadingSkeletonSection`
- **LoadingView.swift**: Comprehensive loading components including `SkeletonLoadingView` and `SkeletonShape`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Views Needing Enhancement
- **TestsListView**: Only basic `ProgressView()` in `loadingView`
- **AppointmentsView**: No skeleton loading - only `ProgressView()` for authentication redirect
- **DashboardView**: Only basic `ProgressView()` for activities
- **ReportsView**: Basic loading states only
- **HealthPackageDetailsView**: Needs skeleton enhancement
